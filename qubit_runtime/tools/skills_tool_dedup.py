"""skill_view repeat-view dedup registry: per-task cache of (resolved skill name, file_path) ->
digest of the skill_view result served. A repeat view whose result is byte-identical returns a short
stub — the earlier tool result already carries the content verbatim. Content digests need no file
timestamps, so a same-size rewrite in one coarse mtime tick (or on a host whose clock disagrees with
the filesystem's) is never mistaken for "unchanged". Cleared via ``reset_skill_view_dedup()`` on
context compression AND on a committed proactive tool-result prune, because both replace the
original content with a one-line marker.
